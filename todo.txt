you need to make a function or IF statement to tell your app to look at the process.env in heroku when .env is not available

Hi Diya, so what I remember we did last was move the config file out of .gitignore, 
create a new config directory and put passport.js and database.js in the config directory.  
The database and server have to point to the same place, otherwise Heroku won't deploy it. 
Look inside my passport.js and database.js and make sure all your configuration are set up the same
